When you open a page, the browser starts downloading a bunch of files in order to display it. Research shows that <a href=\"https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-images\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">images are the most requested asset type</a> and take up more bandwidth than any other resource. So, making sure they are as small as they can be can greatly improve the load times for your website. (spoiler alert: mine’s become 85% faster!)</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-efficient-formats\">More efficient formats<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#more-efficient-formats\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>For a long time, JPGs and PNGs have been our standard image formats. However, they are not optimized for the web - their quality is often unnecessarily high and the download size is too big. Over time, many new formats have appeared, but two of them have become quite notable: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WebP</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/avif-image-format/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AVIF</a>.</p>\n<p>WebP has been introduced in 2010, and has slowly gained adoption since then. Since 2020, <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/webp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WebP is now supported in all modern browsers</a>. AVIF <a href=\"https://jakearchibald.com/2020/avif-has-landed/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">was launched in 2020</a>, and its adoption has been faster. As of January 2021 it is supported by all Chromium-based browsers, and Firefox will start supporting it on version 86, scheduled to release before March.</p>\n<p><em>But how do we use those shiny new formats if not all browsers support them?</em></p>\n<p>With the HTML <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element, we can make the browsers do the work for us. We can declare multiple sources for the same image, and the browser will try to load them in order. If they do not support a format, they will immediatelly jump to the next one.</p>\n<p>So, what we want to do is declare those different sources in the following order:</p>\n<p>AVIF -&gt; WebP -&gt; JPG (or PNG)</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\">\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">html</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-html\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>picture</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- If this type(avif) is supported, use this src --></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>source</span>\n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">type</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>image/avif<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> \n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">srcset</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>my-image.avif<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> \n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- Else, if this type(webp) is supported, use this src instead --></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>source</span>\n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">type</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>image/webp<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span>\n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">srcset</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>my-image.webp<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- Else, fall back to jpg --></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>img</span> \n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">src</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>my-image.jpg<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> \n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">alt</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>A test image<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> \n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">loading</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>lazy<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> \n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">decoding</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>async<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>picture</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<p>If you look at the resulting HTML in your website, you can see that the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element has a <code>src</code> defined, but when you hover over it, it shows what is the actual file that’s being loaded. If you’re on a supported browser, it will have loaded the AVIF file. If you’re on Safari, it will have loaded the WebP one. Otherwise, if you’re using IE or something (I’m sorry), the original JPG or PNG file will be loaded.</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/generated-html.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/generated-html.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/generated-html.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the generated HTML code\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  <figcaption><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The img tag shows the PNG file as source, but hovering the mouse over it reveals that the AVIF file is the one that actually loaded.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></figcaption>\n</picture>\n<h2 id=\"load-smaller-images\">Load smaller images<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#load-smaller-images\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>You can optimize even further than that. See, in my example, I am loading an image with a width of 1200px, however, the size it’s being displayed is only 319px wide. The <code>srcset</code> property supports different widths to load, depending on the screen size.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\">\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">html</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-html\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>picture</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- Here, we declare the widths our different files have: 380px, 640px and 960px --></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>source</span>\n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">type</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>image/avif<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> \n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">srcset</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>\n      my-image-380w.avif 380w,\n      my-image-640w.avif 640w,\n      my-image-960w.avif 960w\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span>\n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">sizes</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 640px<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>img</span> \n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">src</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>my-image.jpg<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> \n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">alt</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>A test image<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> \n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">loading</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>lazy<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> \n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">decoding</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>async<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>picture</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<p>The <code>srcset</code> property is smart. As the name implies, it is a set of sources, not just a single one. When we declare multiple file paths and add a width unit besides it, the browser looks at this data and tries to display the smallest possible image.</p>\n<p>On the code snippet above, the browser will follow this: <span class=\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\">If the size of the displayed image (on the page) is smaller or equal to 380px, it will load the file with 380px of width. Otherwise, it will try to load the next declared path (640px).</span></p>\n<p><strong>However,</strong> not all parts of this process are smarty. The browser cannot know what is the final size of the image on the page before it actually loads it. Which is why the <code>sizes</code> property exists. Let’s see how it works:</p>\n<p>The <code>sizes</code> property defines what rule the browser will use to get the width it uses to choose the correct file in <code>srcset</code>. The default value is <code>100vw</code>. That means that, to check what width the image will have, the browser just gets the width of the browser window. If we know the exact size the image will have on load, we can declare it here, or if we don’t know the exact size, we can estimate. We can use media queries to help us specify the sizes better as well.</p>\n<p>Check out the value on the example: <code>(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 640px</code>. What that code does is: if the width of the viewport is equal or smaller than 979px, use 100vw. Else, use 640px.</p>\n<p>It is easier to understand if we visualize it like this:</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/sizes.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/sizes.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/sizes.png\" alt=\"Screenshots picturing how the sizes property affects the image loading on both mobile and desktop\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  <figcaption><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->On mobile, the image width is almost the same as the viewport, so it's okay to use 100vw. On desktop, we usually limit the image width, so 640px was the sweet spot in this particular case.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></figcaption>\n</picture>\n<p>Of course, different websites have different needs and situations. Make sure to adapt the code to your specific need. </p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that most phones use a HiDPI mode. This means that <span class=\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\">even though the reported width for the phone above is 375px, the browser will likely use a higher resolution to load the images</span> (usually 2x), in order to serve a higher quality image.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lazy-loading-and-async-decoding\">Lazy Loading and Async Decoding<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#lazy-loading-and-async-decoding\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>You might have noticed the <code>loading=&quot;lazy&quot;</code> and <code>decoding=&quot;async&quot;</code> attributes in the code above. Those are relatively new options that are part of an ongoing effort to make the web faster.</p>\n<p><code>decoding=&quot;async&quot;</code> tells your browser it can try to parallelize loading your image. When your page is loading, it tries to decode both text and images at the same time. On lower-end devices though, decoding heavy images can take a while, and this might block the rendering of the rest of the content. With this option, the browser will try to proceed rendering the rest of the content and render the image later. This can be a great improvement to perceived performance.</p>\n<p><code>loading=&quot;lazy&quot;</code> is probably the most important of the two. It is an easy way of telling the browser to <span class=\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\">only load the images when they get close to appearing in the viewport</span>. There is a threshold that is defined by the browser that controls how close it needs to be before it gets loaded, so you don’t have to worry about them not showing up if the user scrolls fast. <span class=\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\">This ensures that the initial load of the website is as lean as it can get, improving perceived performance and also saving you some money on server requests.</span></p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/first-load-requests.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/first-load-requests.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/first-load-requests.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the image requests made on first load of my website\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  <figcaption><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->When the website is initially loaded, it only downloads what's needed: my avatar image and the preview of the first blog post, that will show up after scrolling a bit.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></figcaption>\n</picture>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/after-scrolling-requests.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/after-scrolling-requests.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/after-scrolling-requests.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the image requests made after scrolling a bit\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  <figcaption><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->When I scroll down the page, the images are downloaded as they're close to appearing.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></figcaption>\n</picture>\n<h2 id=\"results-in-practice\">Results In Practice<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#results-in-practice\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>Since I like using my own website and blog as a testbed for new stuff that I learn, I have applied these optimizations to it. The results were incredible!</p>\n<p>Note: after doing some tests, I have decided that the benefits of serving differently-sized images on my website were too small to justify the extra effort of handling all these extra images. So, the only optimizations I have really applied were the optimized file formats, lazy loading and async decoding. I also chose PNG as fallback type instead of JPG because some of my images have transparency in them, which JPG does not support.</p>\n<p>The following data is taken from the home page of the website, since it has a lot of images:</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/results.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/results.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/results.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the difference in download size before and after the optimizations\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  \n</picture>\n<span class=\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\">The total download size decreased by a whopping 85%!!</span> That&#39;s an incredible difference, with no noticeable difference in quality. Your results may vary, as they depend on how much of your website&#39;s size is images.\n<p>Before the changes, out of 1.6MB total, 92% of it were images, 5% were fonts, 1% was HTML, and the remaining 2% were of JS and other things like the web manifest.</p>\n<p>Now, out of 249kB, just 24% of it are images. Fonts now make up 27% of page size, and are likely the target of a future optimization post!</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-hard-part\">The Hard Part<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#the-hard-part\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>The hardest part of this process is converting the images to all necessary formats and sizes.

Take in mind how Android’s Recent Apps screen works, for example:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/css-scroll-snapping/android-scroll-snapping.gif\" alt=\"Android's Recent Apps screen has scroll mapping between app cards\"></p>\n<p>You can see that Android never allows the end of a scroll to be in a place between cards. There’s a certain threshold that determines that the scroll will snap into the nearest card and put it in the center. All that while still keeping scrolling momentum, allowing you to go from one edge of the list to another in a single scroll if you want to.</p>\n<p>Until recently, you’d have to resort to JavaScript code to make a similar behavior on the web. But now, all you need is CSS, which makes things more performant, consistent and reliable! Browser support is already pretty good, with all major browser engines already supporting it fully. Check out browser support on <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-snappoints\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">caniuse.com</a>.</p>\n<p>I’ve recently added scroll snapping to my own website. You can check it out on the “Work Experience” section in the <a href=\"https://fantinel.dev\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Home page</a>. It’s specially great on mobile!</p>\n<h2 id=\"how\">How?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#how\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>There are two main CSS properties that make the magic happen, one for the parent element, and one for its children.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\">\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">css</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-css\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.parent</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">scroll-snap-type</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> y mandatory<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span>\n<span class=\"token selector\">.child</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">scroll-snap-align</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> start<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"scroll-snap-type\">scroll-snap-type<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#scroll-snap-type\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<p>This property tells the browser that the parent element uses scroll snapping. We are given some options on how snapping must work. <code>y</code> indicates that the scroll happens vertically, while <code>x</code> means horizontally. We can also pass the <code>mandatory</code> and <code>proximity</code> options. </p>\n<p>We use <code>mandatory</code> to tell that the browser <em>must</em> snap to a snap point when the user stops scrolling. This means that if the next snap point becomes visible on the screen and scrolling stops, the browser will automatically snap to the next one. In the other end, with <code>proximity</code>, things are less strict. The browser will only snap to the next snap point if scrolling gets past a certain threshold. Both values are useful, their use will depend on the situation you’re applying it to.</p>\n<iframe height=\"500\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"scroll-snap-type: Mandatory vs Proximity\" src=\"https://codepen.io/matfantinel/embed/preview/LYNPdpE?default-tab=result&theme-id=dark\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\">See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matfantinel/pen/LYNPdpE\">scroll-snap-type: Mandatory vs Proximity</a> by Matheus Fantinel (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/matfantinel\">@matfantinel</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.\n</iframe>\n<h3 id=\"scroll-snap-align\">scroll-snap-align<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#scroll-snap-align\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<p>This is a property you add to the children that specifies where the snap points will be in the element. Which means that, whenever the browser automatically snaps the scroll to the element, it will either go to the left/top edge (<code>start</code>), center (<code>center</code>), or right/bottom edge (<code>end</code>) of the element. This property pretty much only makes a difference if the children are bigger than the parent’s display size.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scroll-padding-and-scroll-margin\">scroll-padding and scroll-margin<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#scroll-padding-and-scroll-margin\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<p>To make things even better, we can use the <code>scroll-padding</code> (for parent) and <code>scroll-margin</code> (for children) properties. They add some space before/after the elements that are only considered when scrolling. The best way to implement them is by trying it out after you build your scroll snapping goodiness.</p>\n<p>You can check the documentation over on <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Scroll_Snap\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mozilla Developer Network</a> for more info.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#wrapping-up\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>Scroll snapping is a sign that the web is maturing. For years we’ve been bloating websites with a lot of JavaScript for very simple visual tasks, and now CSS is slowly evolving to take some space back.

I’ll explain it below:</p>\n<p>First of all, on our main.js file, we need to create our Worker object, passing our Worker file as a parameter:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\"><div class=\"filename svelte-qgch0c\">main.js</div>\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">javascript</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>window<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>Worker<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">//just to make sure our browser supports it</span>\n\t<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> myWorker <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Worker</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"worker.js\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<p>The main thread is able to communicate with workers using the <code>postMessage</code> and <code>onMessage</code> functions.</p>\n<p>Let’s make our worker multiply two numbers for us!</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\"><div class=\"filename svelte-qgch0c\">main.js</div>\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">javascript</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token comment\">// we pass an array with all the parameters we want</span>\nmyWorker<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">postMessage</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">123</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">456</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<p>And then listen to a message sent back from our worker:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\"><div class=\"filename svelte-qgch0c\">main.js</div>\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">javascript</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-javascript\">myWorker<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function-variable function\">onmessage</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">function</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">e</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span>\n    result<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>textContent <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> e<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>data<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<p>We are now successfully passing and receiving data to/from our worker. Now, for the worker.js file:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\"><div class=\"filename svelte-qgch0c\">worker.js</div>\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">javascript</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token function-variable function\">onmessage</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">function</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">e</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> result <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> e<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>data<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> e<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>data<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token function\">postMessage</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>result<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<p>Very simple, right? The multiplication was done in a different thread, and therefore did not interfere with our main thread. Keep in mind though, that <strong>setting up a Worker, starting another thread and passing parameters still take up minor resources from the main thread</strong>. For simple examples like this, performance will likely be worse than before. <strong>Web Workers are made for heavy tasks, so don’t just use them everywhere</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"just-a-last-little-thing\">Just a last little thing…<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#just-a-last-little-thing\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>When trying it out locally, you may find that your code… does not work. Neither Chrome nor Firefox allow running worker files from a local file system. This means that you have to be running your website in some sort of HTTP server in order for it to work.</p>\n<p>If you have Python installed (most Linux or MacOS systems already do), just run: <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000</code> and you’re good to go. You can access your files through localhost:8000.</p>\n<p>If you don’t, you can also use <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this Chrome extension</a> or any other method you prefer.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>","css":{"code":".code-block.svelte-qgch0c.svelte-qgch0c{display:block;position:relative;background-color:var(--code-background-color);color:var(--code-text-color);font-family:var(--mono-font);font-size:1rem;line-height:1.33em;border-radius:8px;box-shadow:var(--card-shadow);padding:30px 15px;margin:30px 0}.code-block.svelte-qgch0c pre{overflow-x:auto;scrollbar-color:var(--primary-color) var(--scrollbar-track-color);scrollbar-width:thin;padding-bottom:5px}.code-block.svelte-qgch0c pre::-webkit-scrollbar{height:8px}.code-block.svelte-qgch0c pre::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{background:var(--primary-color)}.code-block.svelte-qgch0c pre::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover{background:var(--primary-light-color)}.code-block.svelte-qgch0c .lang.svelte-qgch0c{position:absolute;right:0;top:-15px;background:inherit;border-radius:8px;padding:5px 10px;z-index:2;font-size:0.85em}.code-block.svelte-qgch0c .filename.svelte-qgch0c{background:inherit;border-top-left-radius:8px;border-top-right-radius:8px;margin-bottom:-2px;padding:5px 10px;position:absolute;left:0px;top:-15px;z-index:1}","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"5 min read"}]}
