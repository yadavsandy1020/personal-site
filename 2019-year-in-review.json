I wanted to write this blog post to sum up stuff that I’ve done or learned this year. Keep in mind this is being written off the top of my head - I did not keep a journal throughout the year, but hopefully that’s something I’ll do in 2020.</p>\n<h2>Complexity is your enemy</h2>\n<p>As programmers, we are puzzle-solvers. We like to think outside the box, applying different concepts, putting all of those nice things we’ve learned everywhere. This… often backfires. Most of the time what works best are the simplest solutions, which are also easier to maintain in the future by you or others. I’ve seen this quote somewhere a while back: “Programmers spend the first years of their careers mastering complexity only to realize they should master simplicity instead”. I guess I’m not in my first years anymore?</p>\n<p>I’ve changed my process in writing code to this:</p>\n<ol><li>Understand the problem/goal;</li>\n<li>Draw a simple mental picture of how to solve it (really simplify it);</li>\n<li>Code in small steps and test them as you go;</li>\n<li>Make it work. Code can look quite ugly in this step;</li>\n<li>Optimize it, performance-wise;</li>\n<li>⭐️ Try to explain how it works to yourself (mentally or by text), and then refactor the code to be as simple as possible;</li></ol>\n<p>This last step might make the initial release take a little longer, but oh boy does it pay off whenever you or someone else has to maintain it.</p>\n<h2>Vanilla JS is the best</h2>\n<p>Wait, I’m not saying you shouldn’t use any framework. If it helps you do your work better, go ahead! But “Vanilla” JS has come such a long way and there are so many amazing APIs coming out that using it solely is a valid option again. But more than that, those APIs are built in a way that popular frameworks can use them and communicate with each other with little effort. I’ve covered a bit of this on <a href=\"/microfrontends/\">my Microfrontends post</a>, but there are more APIs that I’ve discovered this year that are pretty awesome:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/microfrontends/\">Web Components/Shadow DOM/Custom Elements</a>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"/web-workers/\">Web Workers</a>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IntersectionObserver</a>;</li>\n<li>Not exactly new, but <a href=\"/what-are-pwas-and-why-should-i-care-about-them/\">PWAs</a> are increasingly awesome;</li></ul>\n<h2>Jekyll</h2>\n<p>I’m a bit late to the party, but this is still something I’ve found out about in 2019. This website/blog you’re seeing is built on top of Jekyll, a tool for making static websites.</p>\n<p>Basically, you have HTML, CSS and JS. Add some special powers for using variables/loops inside that HTML code and ta-da! It works. Jekyll also allows you to create pages from Markdown (.md) files. I use it for blog posts like this one.</p>\n<p>Since it’s a static website, it means the code that’s served to users/visitors is compiled just once and then served as HTML files. No servers or APIs necessary. It’s pretty cool. You can check more about Jekyll <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and can check the source code for my website <a href=\"https://github.com/matfantinel/matfantinel.github.io\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Open Source is awesome</h2>\n<p>I have released two open-source apps this year for elementaryOS (<a href=\"https://github.com/matfantinel/reminduck\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Reminduck</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/matfantinel/moneta\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Moneta</a>). I gotta say, besides the fact that I was learning an entirely different development stack (Vala, GTK, Desktop native), the best “new” thing I enjoyed was doing it in the open.</p>\n<p>These are not complex, commercial apps or anything like that. They’re small utilities that I use on a daily basis and that were made open and released in hopes of helping anyone out there too. And I gotta say, having users like your software is great, but having them actively contribute to it is even better. As soon as they were released/made public, I started receiving pull requests, bug reports, feature requests, and translations from everywhere. <strong>It’s so amazing that people from all over the world took interest in my little idea and helped improve them any way they could.</strong></p>\n<p>But open source is not just other people contributing to your projects, it’s also the opposite! I can improve other people’s apps that I use, I can report bugs openly and help out, or just download the source code, change a few things just to fit my workflow better and run it. And not only apps, I can do that with the entire OS I run on my PC! Not to mention having access to other people’s code allows you to learn from their work and saves you tons of time. Having a problem on your app and you know one that has solved that? Just check out what they did. Copy it, modify it, learn it, ship it. It’s all good.  <span class=\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\">We wouldn’t have to spend so much time reinventing wheels if more of our code was open.</span></p>\n<p>Ah, this website is also open source. I used others as inspiration and took some code snippets too! So can you, feel free to fork it and modify anyway you want.</p>\n<h2>Working remotely is fun, at least for some people</h2>\n<p>In August I started working remotely for the first time. I work from my home in Brazil with people from US, Europe and India. It was definitely refreshing to not have to commute and always be at a place that makes you feel good. Not only that, but the flexible hours allow me to work whenever I want and I can enjoy things that weren’t possible on a regular “9 to 5” routine.</p>\n<p>Although… I end up working the same hours as I did before. It feels “right” to work at this time, and I can enjoy my family at night, since they also work during the day. But it’s nice to have the flexibility to have a break and a coffee somewhere else during the day if needed.</p>\n<p>One of the main things people say about working from home is that sometimes it’s hard to separate work time from free time. Fortunately, I didn’t have that issue. My apartment is quite small, so I don’t have a proper office and instead work on a desk on my bedroom, which means the temptation of lying down and sleeping is always beside me. I’m so thankful I am able to resist that and get work done. And after work hours I can fully disconnect from it and not be stressed out, even if I stay on the computer. I totally understand why some people would not enjoy this and would be less productive, fortunately I was not the case.</p>\n<p>The one thing I’d say is worse in my case is communication. I’m not an extremely social person - therefore I don’t miss chitchat during the day with colleagues or anything like that. It’s just that it’s harder to explain code and concepts over a call or screen share. Not everyone is always readily available to explain things because of different timezones, so you have to figure more things out on your own. It’s still doable though, and the days of “just coding” without interruptions are a dream. The pros outweight the cons.</p>\n<h2>There’s never enough time</h2>\n<p>This year, I started getting into writing more open source software and started working from home. The latter means I can work more on house chores since there’s no commute and I’m always around! Still, there’s never enough time for me to do what I want to do. I took time to write some elementaryOS apps, but I want to do some web apps too, and code some more, and play some games, watch series, movies, hang out with family, work, write on this blog, oof. This isn’t a new discovery by any means, but I feel like it’s getting worse every year. This is adult life, I guess.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\n<p>Anyway, 2019 was a good year. I (of course) hope to do more and better in 2020, hopefully including more articles here. Hope you all have some nice holidays and a great new year!</p>","css":{"code":".wrapper.svelte-1sgfl7c{background:var(--highlight-marker-url)}","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"7 min read","relatedPosts":[{"slug":"2020-year-in-review","title":"Looking Back at 2020","date":"2020-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","excerpt":"2020 definitely wasn't our best year... but let's remember what was good about it.","tags":["Meta"],"html":"<p>We all know this year hasn’t been easy. That doesn’t mean it had to be wasted. Regardless of how bad or good it has been for oneself individually, there are always lots of lessons we can learn from what we’ve been through.</p>\n<h2>More Than One Pandemic</h2>\n<p>I think one of the most obvious takeaways from this year is that we are not living just one pandemic (COVID-19), but also one that’s equally worrisome and potentially even deadlier: misinformation. The sheer amount of false information and hatred being spread through both social media and real life is becoming bigger every passing day.</p>\n<p>They can be shared by ignorance, personal or political interest, or simply to “watch the world burn”. It is painful to watch the world go backwards like this; especially when people close to you are affected as well. </p>\n<h2>Mental Health</h2>\n<p>I am sure that regardless of any individual impact the pandemics have had, your mental health must have been impacted by all of this somehow. “Doomscrolling” became a thing, fueled by our time watching and reading terrible news while quarantining in the safety of our homes.</p>\n<p>Initially, I was guilty of that too. Checking many times a day for news, how the pandemic was growing, getting angry at how our leaders were dealing with it, and more. Fortunately, I ended up realizing how harmful that was to my mental health, and that there was no good coming out of it. <span class=\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\">A few minutes a day is enough to catch up on important news, the rest of the day can be spent on myself.</span> So instead of mindlessly scrolling through the doom and gloom on the internet, I started to work on more personal projects, learning new stuff, and playing games.</p>\n<h2>Learning with Personal Projects</h2>\n<p>This year I worked on a few personal projects, and tried different approaches with them so I could learn new things. I didn’t necessarily get really in-depth into most of the things I learned, but the knowledge I got definitely made me a better developer.</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/2020-year-in-review/pocket-companion.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/2020-year-in-review/pocket-companion.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/2020-year-in-review/pocket-companion.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of my Pocket Companion app\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  \n</picture>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/\">I built an Animal Crossing companion app</a>, with great utilities for when playing the game. I focused a lot on CSS animations for this one, while trying to mimic the official Nintendo app in looks. Learned a lot of things while building it:<ul><li>State management in Angular projects, with <a href=\"https://ngrx.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NgRx</a>;</li>\n<li>Offline functionality with IndexedDB in the browser;</li>\n<li>Improved CSS Animations;</li>\n<li>Improved Ionic and PWA knowledge;</li>\n<li>Improved performance knowledge, with Web Workers, Virtual Scrolling and Lazy Loading;</li></ul></li>\n<li>I redesigned part of my website - I decided to change things up a bit, with an animated (but still lightweight) header background, a new logo, typography improvements, code highlighting, and more. I think it looks more professional than before, and represents my way of building things better as well;</li>\n<li>I built <a href=\"https://github.com/matfantinel/resume\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">my Resume as a Web Component</a> - using StencilJS to build it, and CSS Grid for the layout. Both of those things were new to me, so it was pretty interesting;</li>\n<li>I learned about <a href=\"/css-scroll-snapping/\">CSS Scroll Snapping</a> - a fantastic new CSS capability that helps with reducing the amount of JS in our websites;</li>\n<li>I focused a lot on improving my design skills this year. While I’m still a developer (and plan on continuing to be), designing things is something I find very fun. I learned messing with a few design-related things this year:<ul><li>Edit SVG files in Inkscape - still a lot to learn, but I’m already capable of doing some edits to existing files;</li>\n<li>Build high-fidelity mockups in Figma - being able to design more quickly than I was by building it was great for speeding up the process, and being able to collect feedback earlier was fantastic as well;</li></ul></li>\n<li>I started to contribute a bit more to Open Source projects, like <a href=\"https://elementary.io\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">elementary OS</a>. Mainly with a still-in-progress website rebuild, but also with tons of feedback, issue reports, offering support and participating on discussions.</li></ul>\n<h2>Fun</h2>\n<p>Since I committed myself to stop seeing bad things and focus on good ones, I resorted to at-home entertainment a lot this year. My highlights:</p>\n<h3>TV and Movies</h3>\n<ul><li><p><strong>Mr. Robot</strong> was a jaw-dropping series. I started watching it just this year, and binged to the finale quickly. It was an incredibly powerful series, with genius writing and cinematography. Highly recommend it to anyone, even if not a fan of the tech/hacking theme;</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Community</strong> was a great find; It’s not a series I had ever heard of when it was still airing, as it never got popular here in Brazil. However, after hearing about it on the web and finding it on Netflix, I’m so glad I started watching it. Loads of fun, full of references, internal jokes and Dan Harmon genius;</p></li></ul>\n<h3>Games</h3>\n<ul><li><p><strong>Animal Crossing New Horizons</strong> was one of the best things to happen this year. It’s far from a perfect game, but it could not have been better for the current situation, providing an easy escape into a world free of our current burdens. It came out at the beginning of quarantine and still provides daily wholesomeness to this day;</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong> was a surprising source of fun considering my party only played online this year. But even with social distancing, we managed to have a lot of fun. With <a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FoundryVTT</a>, things are much easier to handle and it’s not much harder to get immersed. I’m even trying to be a DM of my own campaign… I’m not sure it’s going as well as I hoped, but hey, at least I’m trying.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Hollow Knight</strong>… I’m so glad I played it. Being a Metroidvania, a genre I’m not really a fan of, it completely hooked me with its worldbuilding, art style, atmosphere and frustratingly satisfying difficulty. A 10/10 for me, for sure;</p></li></ul>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/2020-year-in-review/hollow-knight.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/2020-year-in-review/hollow-knight.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/2020-year-in-review/hollow-knight.png\" alt=\"Hollow Knight official artwork\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  <figcaption><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Hollow Knight official artwork, by Team Cherry<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></figcaption>\n</picture>\n<h2>Writing</h2>\n<p>Well, since this is only the third blog post this year, I definitely did not do much writing. I haven’t felt inspired to do so, as I was often busy building nice things or winding down from all the mess that was going on. I’ll repeat my intention of trying to write more next year, of course, since it shouldn’t be hard to do at least more than in 2020.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>\n<p>If you’re still reading, thanks! You’re probably my mom or fiancée. Anyway, 2020 was a very exciting year, even if not in a good way. Let’s hope 2021 is a more boring one.

It came out at the start of quarantine - and was extremely popular for providing an escape from that, with a virtual life that’s free of the problems we’re facing on the real one.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, I was re-discovering <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ionic</a> and wanted to work on an app that would help me improve my knowledge of it, and as a bonus learn about other stuff I’ve been interested in. So, I decided to work on a companion app for the game I’ve been playing so much.</p>\n<p>This post illustrates my experience developing it. It is not a tutorial or an in-depth guide.

Even though you can create an app via their CLI, they also provide <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/start\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">an online App Wizard</a> to do that visually. It’s a pretty cool way to display the starting templates, easily setting theme colors, default icon and the JS Framework you’ll use. I chose Angular for this one.</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/wizard.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/wizard.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/wizard.png\" alt=\"Ionic app creation Wizard\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  \n</picture>\n<p>After setting it up, the wizard gives you a CLI command with an ID to run on your machine. Therefore it still uses the CLI in the end, but it’s a nice touch for the starting experience.</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/all-set.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/all-set.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/all-set.png\" alt=\"The wizard gives you a CLI command with an ID for you to run on your machine\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  \n</picture>\n<p>After running that command, the CLI prompted me if I wanted to integrate with <a href=\"https://capacitorjs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Capacitor</a>, which is a tool that makes the app deployable to Android/iOS. I accepted, since I plan to release it on the Play Store at some point. The main goal is to release the app as a <a href=\"/what-are-pwas-and-why-should-i-care-about-them/\">PWA</a>, but an Android version wouldn’t hurt, since the publishing process is almost-free and there’s almost zero extra effort involved. Publishing it for iPhones is not a goal due to the cost and effort required to publish on the App Store.</p>\n<p>After installation, I could run the app with <code>ionic serve</code>, which resulted in a template app with the settings I had set on the App Wizard.</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/initial-template.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/initial-template.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/initial-template.png\" alt=\"The app created from the template created earlier\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  \n</picture>\n<p>The default folder structure is pretty straightforward and should be familiar to anyone who has ever worked with Angular before.</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/default-folder-structure.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/default-folder-structure.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/default-folder-structure.png\" alt=\"Default folder structure on an Ionic Angular app\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  \n</picture>\n<h2>Starting development</h2>\n<p>Since I am a visual person, I decided to start work by changing the looks of the app first. This helps me stay motivated since I can see progress faster (because everything I do results in a visual change), and it also allows me to visualize the final product earlier, and gives me more time to think of good features or UX improvements.</p>\n<p>Even though I generated my project using the Tabs template, I decided that I don’t want tabs in my app. So I had to do a few changes to the routing configuration.</p>\n<p>First, I created a new page that I can use as the initial screen for my app. Ionic CLI makes it easy to create pages and components. Just running <code>ionic generate page home</code> created a page called Home, and automatically adds its modules to the Angular config, and its route to the Angular Router.</p>\n<p>After that, to remove the tabs, all I had to do was set the default route (<code>&#39;&#39;</code>) to redirect to home, and then I could delete all the Tab pages.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\"><div class=\"filename svelte-qgch0c\">app-routing.module.ts</div>\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">typescript</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-typescript\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span> NgModule <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'@angular/core'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span> PreloadAllModules<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> RouterModule<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> Routes <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'@angular/router'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> routes<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> Routes <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span>\n    path<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">''</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    redirectTo<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'home'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    pathMatch<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'full'</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span>\n    path<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'home'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token function-variable function\">loadChildren</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token keyword\">import</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'./home/home.module'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">then</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span> m <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> m<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>HomePageModule<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token decorator\"><span class=\"token at operator\">@</span><span class=\"token function\">NgModule</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span>\n  imports<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n    RouterModule<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">forRoot</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>routes<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span> preloadingStrategy<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> PreloadAllModules <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  exports<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>RouterModule<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">AppRoutingModule</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<h2>Theming and Layout</h2>\n<p>For me, this is the best part. Ionic makes it SO easy to change themes! There’s a <code>variables.scss</code> file on the <code>theme</code> folder, where you can find Ionic’s default color palette and change anything. But they provide <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/docs/theming/color-generator\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">an amazing Color Generator</a> that can make all the palette calculations for you. Just put your primary/secondary/success/danger/etc colors in there, and it will output the code for you to paste on your app.</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/color-generator.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/color-generator.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/color-generator.png\" alt=\"Ionic&#39;s color generation\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  \n</picture>\n<p>After some time styling, I modified the layout of the two page skeletons I wanna have, the Home page (that mimics the Nookphone in the game), and I styled the header of the other pages.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/skeleton.gif\" alt=\"Gif of my app's base skeleton\"></p>\n<p>Since I wanted to have the same header on all pages, I ended up creating a component for it. Since I had already two components and six pages, I decided to split them up in different folders (I honestly don’t know why Ionic doesn’t do that by default). My folder structure ended up like this:</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/modified-folder-structure.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/modified-folder-structure.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/modified-folder-structure.png\" alt=\"The folder structure after my modifications\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  \n</picture>\n<p>Also, to be able to import the same component into multiple Pages (each page with its own module), I had to create the ComponentsModule. This required a bit of searching because I wasn’t familiar with this approach yet. ComponentsModule by itself is very simple, I just import the Components there:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\"><div class=\"filename svelte-qgch0c\">components.module.ts</div>\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">typescript</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-typescript\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span> NgModule <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'@angular/core'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span> CoolHeaderComponent <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'./cool-header/cool-header.component'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span> IonicModule <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'@ionic/angular'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token decorator\"><span class=\"token at operator\">@</span><span class=\"token function\">NgModule</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span>\n    declarations<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>CoolHeaderComponent<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    imports<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>IonicModule<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">forRoot</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    exports<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>CoolHeaderComponent<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">ComponentsModule</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<p>The annoying part was having to add ComponentsModule to each of the pages. There probably is an easier way of handling this, but right now I decided to not dig too deep into it.</p>\n<p>After making the skeleton of the app, I started working on some specific pages. I started with the home screen, that mimics a cell phone’s app grid. I’ll probably add more options as the app evolves, but for now this is good enough to build the layout with.</p>\n<p>The next screen to be done was the <em>Island</em> one. It is a simple form with some text inputs, a datepicker and a couple of dropdowns. I used Ionic’s default components for them and styled them with CSS so they fit the app’s style better. Everything was pretty simple to do and worked great. Ionic’s docs made it super easy to find the available options and easier ways to theme.</p>\n<p>I wanted to add another thing to this screen too, though: a section containing the island’s villagers, and a search box that allows the user to select them. Just adding another “card” to the UI and making it scroll would deliver what I want, but it wouldn’t look <em>awesome</em>. GitHub’s recently released mobile app has this bottom drawer that I personally found awesome:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/ionic-animal-crossing-companion/github-drawer.gif\" alt=\"GitHub's cool bottom drawer\"></p>\n<p>Luckily for me, someone’s already worked on something like that for Ionic, which means I don’t have to do it from scratch! <a href=\"https://github.com/AnthonyCifuentes/ion-slide-drawer\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to check it on GitHub. Unfortunately it is not (at the time of writing) available as an installable component on NPM or somewhere else. But the code is simple and I just copied it over to my own project.</p>\n<h2>State Management</h2>\n<p>Since the entire point of this app is learning, I decided to use <a href=\"https://ngrx.io\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NgRx</a>. It is a State Management library for Angular that works in a similar way to VueX or Redux. I’ve worked with VueX recently and really like the concept, so I decided to make use of it here.</p>\n<p>I started by adding it to my application with <code>npm i @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/store-devtools @ngrx/schematics --save</code>. If you wanna learn more about NgRx, I used <a href=\"https://indepth.dev/how-to-start-flying-with-angular-and-ngrx/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this amazing tutorial</a> to learn it for this app.</p>\n<h2>Database</h2>\n<p>The best way to store data in an app like mine - supposed to work on Android, iOS and the Web, but still entirely offline - is using the browser’s IndexedDB. It’s basically a simpler SQL database for your web app that lives inside the browser. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">You can read more on MDN if you’d like</a>.</p>\n<p>While useful, IndexedDB has a very low-level API, which makes it hard to get started with. Which is why I chose to use <a href=\"https://dexie.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dexie.js</a> as a wrapper for IndexedDB. It allows me to use a simple API to query data, while already doing the needed optimizations.</p>\n<p>Simply installing Dexie.js and a quick read on its documentation allowed me to successfully store and read persistent data for my app.</p>\n<h2>Putting some other cool things in practice</h2>\n<p>Since the main purpose of developing this app is learning, I decided to use some cool stuff I’ve learned and put them in practice:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/web-workers/\">Web Workers</a>: on first run, the app uses a web worker to parse the game data (contained in large JSON files) in the background, so it can fill the database with the data used on Critterpedia</li>\n<li>Virtual Scroll: on the Critterpedia listings, I used Virtual Scroll instead of pagination. I figured this was a better choice because while it can have a lot of items, it’s a fixed number so no need to paginate. This way it maintains good performance on scrolling even on lower-end devices. Luckily, <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/virtual-scroll\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ionic provides a built-in component for that</a>!</li>\n<li>Lazy loading images: since all items in the list have an icon that’s displayed besides them, there are lots of images to download. Without lazy-loading, ALL images would be loaded right off the bat, even the ones way down the bottom of the list. With lazy loading, the browser automatically downloads only images as they would appear on screen by just setting the <code>loading</code> attribute: <code>&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&gt;</code></li></ul>\n<h2>Running on Android</h2>\n<p>After having a few parts of my app done, I decided it was time to run in on my Android phone, to have a better look of how it will look and feel on an actual device.</p>\n<p>The first step for this is installing Android Studio. Install instructions may vary depending on your operating system. I’m on a Linux-based OS so I installed it from <a href=\"https://snapcraft.io/android-studio\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Snapcraft</a>. You can follow the instructions from the <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/android\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ionic docs</a> if you’d prefer.</p>\n<p>After installing Android Studio, we need to add an environment variable that points to the Android SDK. In the following command (Linux, Mac), replace the directory with the one where the Sdk is installed in your PC, then add it to the end of your <code>.bashrc</code> file:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\">\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">shell</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-shell\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-shell\"><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">export</span> <span class=\"token assign-left variable\">ANDROID_SDK_ROOT</span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token environment constant\">$HOME</span>/Library/Android/sdk</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<p>Adding these next lines to the <code>.bashrc</code> file will also give you a quick way to access these Android tools if needed:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\">\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">shell</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-shell\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-shell\"><span class=\"token comment\"># avdmanager, sdkmanager</span>\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">export</span> <span class=\"token assign-left variable\"><span class=\"token environment constant\">PATH</span></span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token environment constant\">$PATH</span><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">:</span><span class=\"token variable\">$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT</span>/tools/bin\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># adb, logcat</span>\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">export</span> <span class=\"token assign-left variable\"><span class=\"token environment constant\">PATH</span></span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token environment constant\">$PATH</span><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">:</span><span class=\"token variable\">$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT</span>/platform-tools\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># emulator</span>\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">export</span> <span class=\"token assign-left variable\"><span class=\"token environment constant\">PATH</span></span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token environment constant\">$PATH</span><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">:</span><span class=\"token variable\">$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT</span>/emulator</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<p>Now, we have to register Android as a platform for our app. Since we’re using Capacitor to make this bridge, we need only a single command:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\">\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">shell</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-shell\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-shell\">ionic capacitor <span class=\"token function\">add</span> android</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<p><em>If you get an error saying that “Capacitor could not find the web assets directory”, be sure to run <code>ionic build</code> to generate this directory first.</em></p>\n<p>After that’s done, you can open the project in Android Studio (it will be on a folder called <code>Android</code> at the root of your project). If you still haven’t setup a device or emulator to run your app in, do it now. The <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/android#android-studio\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ionic docs</a> show how to do both processes.</p>\n<p>After a loooong while, Android Studio will have loaded all it needs to run your project. Just click on Run (Shift+F10). It should open on your phone/emulator!</p>\n<h2>PWA preparation</h2>\n<p>To be able to publish the app as a PWA, we need to add a Service Worker and a Manifest. Thankfully, Angular already has the CLI and the packages that allows us to do that easily. <code>ng add @angular/pwa</code> worked like a charm. This automatically added the needed files, and wired it up with the existing Angular modules automatically.</p>\n<p>After that, I edited <code>ngsw-config.json</code> and <code>manifest.webmanifest</code> files with my app’s name and colors, and I replaced all generated icons with my own. For more details on how to create PWAs with Angular, <a href=\"/angular-pwa-how-to/\">check my specific post for that</a></p>\n<h3>Routing issue</h3>\n<p>One issue I was having after publishing a PWA like that is that when refreshing my app on the browser, it was throwing a 404 error. This happened because the route had changed and Angular lost track of what it was supposed to open. I fixed this by changing a line in my <code>app-routing.module.ts</code> and adding <code>useHash: true</code> to the settings:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\"><div class=\"filename svelte-qgch0c\">app-routing.module.ts</div>\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">typescript</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-typescript\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token decorator\"><span class=\"token at operator\">@</span><span class=\"token function\">NgModule</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span>\n  imports<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n    RouterModule<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">forRoot</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>routes<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span> preloadingStrategy<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> PreloadAllModules<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> useHash<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  exports<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>RouterModule<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<h3>Publishing</h3>\n<p>To host my PWA, I decided to use <a href=\"https://netlify.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Netlify</a>. The publishing experience was quite easy and friction-free, and they also provide a free hosting plan which is perfect to host this demo-only-app. I will not document how the publishing proccess worked here because their UI is very intuitive and their docs would be way better than mine anyway.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>\n<p>Developing this definitely took me a while - but that’s because time’s been quite scarce for me. Most of the development time was spent learning NgRx, which was definitely the most complex part of this application. It also took me a while to find a good IndexedDB wrapper before I settled on Dexie. The rest was quite straightforward - the app logic is simple, and what took the longest was making the app pretty and the animations smooth. </p>\n<p>I think the result is quite good - definitely not professional, but more than enough for a hobby app. I learned a lot working on it and would definitely do it again.
