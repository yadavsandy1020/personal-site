It is a competitor to the big JS frameworks - React, Vue, Angular - but, instead of simply being an alternative way of doing things, it differentiates itself on a fundamental level: <span class=\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\">it is a compiler, not a framework.</span></p>\n<p>This means that it does its job at build time, not at runtime. While other frameworks (React, for example) need JavaScript code that runs on the client in order for your components to work properly, Svelte does not, because it interprets your code on build time, and only ships exactly what it needs to run. This means websites made with Svelte can be much smaller in size and faster because it has less code to run.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kit.svelte.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SvelteKit</a> is a framework built on top of that. It is an opinionated set of rules that helps you get a Svelte app built pretty quickly. You can compare it to NextJS (for React) or Nuxt (for Vue). It has great defaults and encourages good practices, like server-side rendering, for example. At the time of building this website, SvelteKit was still in Beta. However, progress is steady and its API seems to be already stable, so it’s unlikely there will be any breaking changes before 1.0 arrives.</p>\n<p>Using both of the above allowed my website to have two important characteristics:</p>\n<ul><li>Every single page is rendered at build time (server-side rendering). This means that as long as the HTML and CSS files are downloaded, it will look as it was meant to be;</li>\n<li>JavaScript is not needed. Try disabling JavaScript on your browser. You’ll still be able to read this blog post and everything will look the same.</li></ul>\n<h2 id=\"progressive-enhancement\">Progressive Enhancement<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#progressive-enhancement\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>One of the concepts that really caught my eye with Svelte is the idea of Progressive Enhancement: <span class=\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\">making sure your app runs for everyone, and making it progressively more featureful if the user’s device supports it</span>. My website is a pretty simple project, but still there are instances of this:</p>\n<p>If there’s no JavaScript, the website uses the browser’s native navigation API. Which means you can navigate between pages normally without any client-side code. <em>However</em>, if JavaScript is available, a client-side router will be used to make the transition between pages smoother and faster. This means that even if the user’s device doesn’t support JS for any reason<span class=\"text-info\">*</span>, the site will still be completely functional.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-block info svelte-1pi2pyj\"><div class=\"icon-wrapper svelte-1pi2pyj\"><svg width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M12 11.5V16.5\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\"></path><path d=\"M12 7.51L12.01 7.49889\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\"></path><path d=\"M12 22C17.5228 22 22 17.5228 22 12C22 6.47715 17.5228 2 12 2C6.47715 2 2 6.47715 2 12C2 17.5228 6.47715 22 12 22Z\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\"></path></svg></div>\n\t<span class=\"text-info\">*</span> We tend to think of JavaScript being disabled as a user choice, but that is not always the case. Think of someone using their phone on a weak 3G connection that fails to load the .js files, or someone in a metro that lost signal while loading the page. It happens often and being able to show your content even in these conditions is a great way of not losing a visitor.\n\n</div>\n<p>And you know what I had to do to support this? <em>Nothing</em>. Just using <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements is enough, as SvelteKit will intercept those if needed (JS enabled), or simply leave it to the browser otherwise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"design\">Design<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#design\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>I’m not a designer, but I like the subject. So, instead of designing-as-I-go when developing the website, I decided to fully design it on <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Figma</a> before starting development. I figured that using it to design stuff is the best way to learn the platform, and I really finished this design much better at Figma than I was before. Auto-layout is fantastic since it works so much like CSS Flexbox, so I was able to approach it with a similar thought-process as I have when developing stuff.</p>\n<p>The design itself was something I came up with, and it’s an amalgamation of ideas and inspirations that were stored in my head. When building it, I wasn’t entirely sure where the inspiration came from, but now it is apparent to me that most of it comes from some websites I love: <a href=\"https://www.joshwcomeau.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Comeau’s</a> and <a href=\"https://georgefrancis.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">George Francis’</a>.</p>\n<p>After the design was complete, I finally began developing it. Since there are some things that you can only find out while developing it and giving it more attention, I made some small tweaks to the design while implementing it. Still, the final result was <em>really</em> similar to the initial design. I count that as a success!</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/blog-development-sveltekit/design-vs-result.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/blog-development-sveltekit/design-vs-result.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/blog-development-sveltekit/design-vs-result.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the intial design versus the final result, with minimal differences\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  <figcaption><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The design (left) and the result (right)<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></figcaption>\n</picture>\n<h2 id=\"routing\">Routing<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#routing\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>SvelteKit uses filesystem-based routing, which means that anything inside a <code>routes</code> folder will be accessible via its own path, without the need of manually declaring routes.</p>\n<p>My website has 4 different pages in total: home, blog, blog post and resume. This means that I can create these pages like this, and their path will already work:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\">\n\t\n\t<pre class=\"language-bash\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-bash\">└── routes\n    ├── __layout.svelte\n    ├── blog.svelte <span class=\"token comment\"># /blog</span>\n    ├── index.svelte <span class=\"token comment\"># /</span>\n    ├── resume.svelte <span class=\"token comment\"># /resume</span>\n    ├── <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>slug<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>.svelte <span class=\"token comment\"># Dynamic route (blog posts)</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<p>The <code>__layout.svelte</code> file is a base layout for all the pages inside the route. Which means that I can have shared code for all pages in there. See the example below, where I added the header and footer components to the __layout, and load the content of the route itself in the <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> element:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\"><div class=\"filename svelte-qgch0c\">__layout.svelte</div>\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">svelte</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-svelte\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-svelte\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>Header</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>main</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n\t<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>slot</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>main</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>Footer</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"blog-post-page--dynamic-routing\">Blog Post Page / Dynamic Routing<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#blog-post-page--dynamic-routing\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<p>But what about the blog post page? Well, that one is a special case. If you look at the URL loaded right now, you’ll see that it is specific to this blog post. However, that doesn’t mean there is one Svelte page for each blog post on the routes directory.</p>\n<p>You see, every blog post page is the same one, however its content is loaded based on the URL it receives. To achieve this, I used SvelteKit’s dynamic routing with a file called <code>[slug].svelte</code>. The brackets indicate that the route might be dynamic, and whatever URL comes in, it will be caught by this file (unless it’s caught by explicit routes like /blog shown above). Not only that, but that part of the URL will be accessible in the page as a parameter (called, in this case, <em>slug</em>). This parameter allows the page to know which blog post to display.</p>\n<p>However, there’s still an extra step I wanted to take. Blog posts only have their own content, but I wanted to add a few extra things on the page that weren’t present in the main __layout.svelte file, like the post title and related posts at the bottom. For that, I used a <strong>layout reset</strong>, defining that the post page shouldn’t use the main one, but instead have its own.</p>\n<p>To avoid repeating [slug] many times, I wrapped both files in a new folder. My routes directory stayed like this:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\">\n\t\n\t<pre class=\"language-bash\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-bash\">└── routes\n    ├── __layout.svelte\n    ├── blog.svelte <span class=\"token comment\"># /blog</span>\n    ├── index.svelte <span class=\"token comment\"># /</span>\n    ├── resume.svelte <span class=\"token comment\"># /resume</span>\n    └── <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>slug<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># Dynamic route (blog posts)</span>\n        ├── __layout.reset.svelte\n        ├── index.svelte</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"the-blog\">The blog<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#the-blog\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>The main challenge for me was in processing Markdown(.md) files of the blog posts into actual Svelte code. Unlike Jekyll, which I was using previously for this blog, SvelteKit doesn’t have anything built-in for this (yet) and online resources are a bit scarce (which is normal, since it’s still in beta).</p>\n<p>I had three requisites for this:</p>\n<ul><li>I wanted to write blog posts in Markdown, because of its ease, and also so I wouldn’t have to rewrite all the existing posts;</li>\n<li>I wanted to be able to use Svelte components inside the blog posts as well, for more interactive elements;</li>\n<li>It has to be rendered on build time so the blog can be deployed to GitHub Pages;</li></ul>\n<p>I had heard about something similar to what I wanted, called MDX. It allows everything I wanted, however, it was React-based and I couldn’t use it. Luckily, I found out about <a href=\"https://mdsvex.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MDsveX</a>, a project with the same goal as MDX, but for Svelte!</p>\n<p>After setting it up, I had to figure out how to actually use it. I found some examples on the internet, which seemed very straightforward. Most of them created a <code>/posts</code> folder inside the routes, and then put the .md files in there. MDsveX would do the work of transforming them into HTML pages on build, and that was it. However, that meant the post URL would have to become <code>https://fantinel.dev/posts/blog-post-name</code>. That isn’t a huge problem by itself, but it was for me because it wouldn’t be backwards-compatible with my previous blog URLs, that have been linked to a few times in other sites. I wanted to remove the need for “/posts” in the URL to keep that compatibility.</p>\n<p>That means my page on <code>routes/[slug]/index.svelte</code> should need some kind of logic that finds the correct blog post to show and dynamically loads the Svelte component generated by MDsveX. Not only that, but I needed to be able to extract the metadata of the post - its title, image, and date - to be able to display it on the __layout.reset.svelte file, and also displaying the “Recent posts” cards on the home page.</p>\n<h3 id=\"extracting-post-data\">Extracting post data<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#extracting-post-data\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<p>I found out when searching that we can import all the .md files as modules, and process them via JS, since this code will run on the server. I ended up creating a <code>posts.js</code> file to centralize this logic, and did the following:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\"><div class=\"filename svelte-qgch0c\">posts.js</div>\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">javascript</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token comment\">// Import the markdown files for each post</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> imports <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">import</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>meta<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">globEager</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'./posts/*.md'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> posts <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> path <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span> imports<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span>\n\t<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> post <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> imports<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>path<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\t<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>post<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// For each of them, MDsveX will do the heavy lifting.

id=\"rss\">RSS<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#rss\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<p>Something that SvelteKit currently does not provide a solution for is a RSS feed. Previously, mine was built automatically by Jekyll and I never had to do anything to get it working. While this wasn’t the case right now, I’m sure once SvelteKit is stable and mature, solutions for this will be available so no manual work has to be done.</p>\n<p>I made mine by taking advantage of <a href=\"https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#routing-endpoints\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SvelteKit’s endpoints</a>, and serving a XML file that is generated at build time. I import the filtered posts from the <code>posts.js</code> file I created earlier, and use the metadata to build the content of the RSS file. You can check out <a href=\"https://github.com/matfantinel/matfantinel.github.io/blob/main/src/routes/rss.xml.js\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the source code</a> for implementation details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sitemap\">Sitemap<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#sitemap\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<p>Another thing that’s still not built-in to SvelteKit is the sitemap. It’s great for SEO, especially for newer websites, so I researched a good way of adding one. Luckily, someone already built a tool to generate them automatically, and there is already a discussion to build it into SvelteKit directly. Check out <a href=\"https://github.com/bartholomej/svelte-sitemap\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">svelte-sitemap</a> for generating your own.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#wrapping-up\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>My first experience with Svelte and SvelteKit was, overall, fantastic. It simplifies many parts of development and having server-side-rendering as a default option really drives forward their purpose of simplifying web both for users and developers.</p>\n<p>Though I definitely did not use all of Svelte’s strengths on this project, since it doesn’t need dynamic data and an application state, I’ll be working with that soon enough. Its ecosystem is not as big as its competitors’, since Svelte is still small compared to them, but they’re doing something right with their new approach, as Svelte is the most loved web framework according to <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the latest StackOverflow survey</a>. Not to mention that Svelte itself doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel, and therefore is compatible with almost everything JavaScript.</p>\n<p>The small issues I’ve had while building this will definitely be gone soon, as they were caused by SvelteKit not being on a stable version yet. I’m excited to see how much the ecosystem grows the next year; I’ll definitely be keeping an eye on it!</p>\n<p>Don’t forget all the code for this website and blog are open source, feel free to use it and to propose changes if you’d like!</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n<div style=\"display: grid;place-items: center;max-width: 300px;margin: 20px auto 0;\"><a href=\"https://github.com/matfantinel/matfantinel.github.io\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"button secondary\"><svg width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M16 22.0268V19.1568C16.0375 18.68 15.9731 18.2006 15.811 17.7506C15.6489 17.3006 15.3929 16.8902 15.06 16.5468C18.2 16.1968 21.5 15.0068 21.5 9.54679C21.4997 8.15062 20.9627 6.80799 20 5.79679C20.4558 4.5753 20.4236 3.22514 19.91 2.02679C19.91 2.02679 18.73 1.67679 16 3.50679C13.708 2.88561 11.292 2.88561 8.99999 3.50679C6.26999 1.67679 5.08999 2.02679 5.08999 2.02679C4.57636 3.22514 4.54413 4.5753 4.99999 5.79679C4.03011 6.81549 3.49251 8.17026 3.49999 9.57679C3.49999 14.9968 6.79998 16.1868 9.93998 16.5768C9.61098 16.9168 9.35725 17.3222 9.19529 17.7667C9.03334 18.2112 8.96679 18.6849 8.99999 19.1568V22.0268\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\"></path><path d=\"M9 20.0267C6 20.9999 3.5 20.0267 2 17.0267\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\"></path></svg>See source code on GitHub</a></div>","css":{"code":".sparkle-wrapper.svelte-exdx8u.svelte-exdx8u{position:relative;display:inline-block}.sparkle-wrapper.svelte-exdx8u .slot-wrapper.svelte-exdx8u{position:relative;z-index:1}\n.wrapper.svelte-1sgfl7c{background:var(--highlight-marker-url)}\n.callout-block.svelte-1pi2pyj.svelte-1pi2pyj{--bg-color:var(--callout-background-color);--accent-color:transparent;margin:40px 0 30px;padding:25px 25px;border-top-right-radius:10px;border-bottom-right-radius:10px;background:var(--bg-color);color:var(--text-color);border-left:4px solid var(--accent-color);position:relative}.callout-block.svelte-1pi2pyj .icon-wrapper.svelte-1pi2pyj{position:absolute;width:50px;height:50px;top:0;left:0;transform:translate(calc(-50% - 1.5px), -50%);background:var(--post-page-background-color);padding:8px;border-radius:50%;fill:var(--accent-color);color:var(--accent-color)}.callout-block.info.svelte-1pi2pyj.svelte-1pi2pyj{--bg-color:var(--callout-info-background-color);--accent-color:var(--callout-info-accent-color)}.callout-block.warning.svelte-1pi2pyj.svelte-1pi2pyj{--bg-color:var(--callout-warning-background-color);--accent-color:var(--callout-warning-accent-color)}.callout-block.error.svelte-1pi2pyj.svelte-1pi2pyj{--bg-color:var(--callout-error-background-color);--accent-color:var(--callout-error-accent-color)}.callout-block.success.svelte-1pi2pyj.svelte-1pi2pyj{--bg-color:var(--callout-success-background-color);--accent-color:var(--callout-success-accent-color)}\npicture.svelte-1gy5t1o.svelte-1gy5t1o{position:relative;width:100%;height:100%}picture.svelte-1gy5t1o img.svelte-1gy5t1o{width:100%;height:100%}\n.code-block.svelte-qgch0c.svelte-qgch0c{display:block;position:relative;background-color:var(--code-background-color);color:var(--code-text-color);font-family:var(--mono-font);font-size:1rem;line-height:1.33em;border-radius:8px;box-shadow:var(--card-shadow);padding:30px 15px;margin:30px 0}.code-block.svelte-qgch0c pre{overflow-x:auto;scrollbar-color:var(--primary-color) var(--scrollbar-track-color);scrollbar-width:thin;padding-bottom:5px}.code-block.svelte-qgch0c pre::-webkit-scrollbar{height:8px}.code-block.svelte-qgch0c pre::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{background:var(--primary-color)}.code-block.svelte-qgch0c pre::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover{background:var(--primary-light-color)}.code-block.svelte-qgch0c .lang.svelte-qgch0c{position:absolute;right:0;top:-15px;background:inherit;border-radius:8px;padding:5px 10px;z-index:2;font-size:0.85em}.code-block.svelte-qgch0c .filename.svelte-qgch0c{background:inherit;border-top-left-radius:8px;border-top-right-radius:8px;margin-bottom:-2px;padding:5px 10px;position:absolute;left:0px;top:-15px;z-index:1}","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"20 min read","relatedPosts":[{"slug":"web-images-modern-formats","title":"Smarter, Lighter, Better Images: A Guide to Optimization","date":"2021-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","excerpt":"Learn how to reduce page loading times and bounce rate.","tags":["Front-End","Guide","HTML","CSS","Optimization"],"html":"<p>Do you know how big the images displayed on your website are?

However, they are not optimized for the web - their quality is often unnecessarily high and the download size is too big. Over time, many new formats have appeared, but two of them have become quite notable: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WebP</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/avif-image-format/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AVIF</a>.</p>\n<p>WebP has been introduced in 2010, and has slowly gained adoption since then. Since 2020, <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/webp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WebP is now supported in all modern browsers</a>. AVIF <a href=\"https://jakearchibald.com/2020/avif-has-landed/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">was launched in 2020</a>, and its adoption has been faster. As of January 2021 it is supported by all Chromium-based browsers, and Firefox will start supporting it on version 86, scheduled to release before March.</p>\n<p><em>But how do we use those shiny new formats if not all browsers support them?</em></p>\n<p>With the HTML <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element, we can make the browsers do the work for us. We can declare multiple sources for the same image, and the browser will try to load them in order. If they do not support a format, they will immediatelly jump to the next one.</p>\n<p>So, what we want to do is declare those different sources in the following order:</p>\n<p>AVIF -&gt; WebP -&gt; JPG (or PNG)</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\">\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">html</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-html\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>picture</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- If this type(avif) is supported, use this src --></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>source</span>\n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">type</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>image/avif<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> \n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">srcset</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>my-image.avif<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> \n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- Else, if this type(webp) is supported, use this src instead --></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>source</span>\n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">type</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>image/webp<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span>\n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">srcset</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>my-image.webp<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- Else, fall back to jpg --></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>img</span> \n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">src</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>my-image.jpg<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> \n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">alt</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>A test image<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> \n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">loading</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>lazy<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> \n    <span class=\"token attr-name\">decoding</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>async<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>picture</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<p>If you look at the resulting HTML in your website, you can see that the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element has a <code>src</code> defined, but when you hover over it, it shows what is the actual file that’s being loaded.

As the name implies, it is a set of sources, not just a single one. When we declare multiple file paths and add a width unit besides it, the browser looks at this data and tries to display the smallest possible image.</p>\n<p>On the code snippet above, the browser will follow this: <span class=\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\">If the size of the displayed image (on the page) is smaller or equal to 380px, it will load the file with 380px of width. Otherwise, it will try to load the next declared path (640px).</span></p>\n<p><strong>However,</strong> not all parts of this process are smarty. The browser cannot know what is the final size of the image on the page before it actually loads it. Which is why the <code>sizes</code> property exists. Let’s see how it works:</p>\n<p>The <code>sizes</code> property defines what rule the browser will use to get the width it uses to choose the correct file in <code>srcset</code>. The default value is <code>100vw</code>. That means that, to check what width the image will have, the browser just gets the width of the browser window. If we know the exact size the image will have on load, we can declare it here, or if we don’t know the exact size, we can estimate. We can use media queries to help us specify the sizes better as well.</p>\n<p>Check out the value on the example: <code>(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 640px</code>. What that code does is: if the width of the viewport is equal or smaller than 979px, use 100vw. Else, use 640px.</p>\n<p>It is easier to understand if we visualize it like this:</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/sizes.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/sizes.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/sizes.png\" alt=\"Screenshots picturing how the sizes property affects the image loading on both mobile and desktop\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  <figcaption><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->On mobile, the image width is almost the same as the viewport, so it's okay to use 100vw. On desktop, we usually limit the image width, so 640px was the sweet spot in this particular case.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></figcaption>\n</picture>\n<p>Of course, different websites have different needs and situations. Make sure to adapt the code to your specific need. </p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that most phones use a HiDPI mode. This means that <span class=\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\">even though the reported width for the phone above is 375px, the browser will likely use a higher resolution to load the images</span> (usually 2x), in order to serve a higher quality image.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lazy-loading-and-async-decoding\">Lazy Loading and Async Decoding<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#lazy-loading-and-async-decoding\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>You might have noticed the <code>loading=&quot;lazy&quot;</code> and <code>decoding=&quot;async&quot;</code> attributes in the code above. Those are relatively new options that are part of an ongoing effort to make the web faster.</p>\n<p><code>decoding=&quot;async&quot;</code> tells your browser it can try to parallelize loading your image. When your page is loading, it tries to decode both text and images at the same time. On lower-end devices though, decoding heavy images can take a while, and this might block the rendering of the rest of the content. With this option, the browser will try to proceed rendering the rest of the content and render the image later. This can be a great improvement to perceived performance.</p>\n<p><code>loading=&quot;lazy&quot;</code> is probably the most important of the two. It is an easy way of telling the browser to <span class=\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\">only load the images when they get close to appearing in the viewport</span>. There is a threshold that is defined by the browser that controls how close it needs to be before it gets loaded, so you don’t have to worry about them not showing up if the user scrolls fast. <span class=\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\">This ensures that the initial load of the website is as lean as it can get, improving perceived performance and also saving you some money on server requests.</span></p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/first-load-requests.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/first-load-requests.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/first-load-requests.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the image requests made on first load of my website\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  <figcaption><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->When the website is initially loaded, it only downloads what's needed: my avatar image and the preview of the first blog post, that will show up after scrolling a bit.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></figcaption>\n</picture>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/after-scrolling-requests.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/after-scrolling-requests.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/after-scrolling-requests.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the image requests made after scrolling a bit\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  <figcaption><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->When I scroll down the page, the images are downloaded as they're close to appearing.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></figcaption>\n</picture>\n<h2 id=\"results-in-practice\">Results In Practice<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#results-in-practice\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>Since I like using my own website and blog as a testbed for new stuff that I learn, I have applied these optimizations to it. The results were incredible!</p>\n<p>Note: after doing some tests, I have decided that the benefits of serving differently-sized images on my website were too small to justify the extra effort of handling all these extra images. So, the only optimizations I have really applied were the optimized file formats, lazy loading and async decoding. I also chose PNG as fallback type instead of JPG because some of my images have transparency in them, which JPG does not support.</p>\n<p>The following data is taken from the home page of the website, since it has a lot of images:</p>\n<picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/results.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n\t<source srcset=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/results.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t<img src=\"/optimized-images/posts/web-images-modern-formats/results.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the difference in download size before and after the optimizations\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\">\n  \n</picture>\n<span class=\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\">The total download size decreased by a whopping 85%!!</span> That&#39;s an incredible difference, with no noticeable difference in quality. Your results may vary, as they depend on how much of your website&#39;s size is images.\n<p>Before the changes, out of 1.6MB total, 92% of it were images, 5% were fonts, 1% was HTML, and the remaining 2% were of JS and other things like the web manifest.</p>\n<p>Now, out of 249kB, just 24% of it are images.

Theoretically, SVGs are infinitely scalable, and should look good on all sizes. Unfortunately, browser support is not there yet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://caniuse.com/link-icon-svg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Can I Use</a> reports that, currently (January 2021), only recent versions of Firefox and Chromium-based browsers support this feature. This means that Safari, non-Chromium Edge, IE, and some mobile browsers do not support it. Therefore, unless you want your favicon to just not appear in those browsers, you’d still have to use other file formats as well. The downside of this approach is that all favicons would look the same, and you won’t be able to customize and have differently-shaped icons for mobile devices, for example.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\">\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">html</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-html\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>head</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>link</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">rel</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>icon<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">href</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>favicon.svg<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>head</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#wrapping-up\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>Favicons suck.

It is getting easier to make smooth and complete experiences without having to use JavaScript at all. Case in point: Scroll Snapping.</p>\n<p>It is an easy way to guarantee that users will scroll to the correct portion of your page or of a container. Picture a landing page that is easily swipable/scrollable between sections, or swipable cards. Take in mind how Android’s Recent Apps screen works, for example:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/css-scroll-snapping/android-scroll-snapping.gif\" alt=\"Android's Recent Apps screen has scroll mapping between app cards\"></p>\n<p>You can see that Android never allows the end of a scroll to be in a place between cards. There’s a certain threshold that determines that the scroll will snap into the nearest card and put it in the center. All that while still keeping scrolling momentum, allowing you to go from one edge of the list to another in a single scroll if you want to.</p>\n<p>Until recently, you’d have to resort to JavaScript code to make a similar behavior on the web. But now, all you need is CSS, which makes things more performant, consistent and reliable! Browser support is already pretty good, with all major browser engines already supporting it fully. Check out browser support on <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-snappoints\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">caniuse.com</a>.</p>\n<p>I’ve recently added scroll snapping to my own website. You can check it out on the “Work Experience” section in the <a href=\"https://fantinel.dev\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Home page</a>. It’s specially great on mobile!</p>\n<h2 id=\"how\">How?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#how\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>There are two main CSS properties that make the magic happen, one for the parent element, and one for its children.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block svelte-qgch0c\">\n\t<div class=\"lang svelte-qgch0c\">css</div>\n\t<pre class=\"language-css\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.parent</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">scroll-snap-type</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> y mandatory<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span>\n<span class=\"token selector\">.child</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">&#123;</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">scroll-snap-align</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> start<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">&#125;</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"scroll-snap-type\">scroll-snap-type<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#scroll-snap-type\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<p>This property tells the browser that the parent element uses scroll snapping. We are given some options on how snapping must work. <code>y</code> indicates that the scroll happens vertically, while <code>x</code> means horizontally. We can also pass the <code>mandatory</code> and <code>proximity</code> options. </p>\n<p>We use <code>mandatory</code> to tell that the browser <em>must</em> snap to a snap point when the user stops scrolling. This means that if the next snap point becomes visible on the screen and scrolling stops, the browser will automatically snap to the next one. In the other end, with <code>proximity</code>, things are less strict. The browser will only snap to the next snap point if scrolling gets past a certain threshold. Both values are useful, their use will depend on the situation you’re applying it to.</p>\n<iframe height=\"500\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"scroll-snap-type: Mandatory vs Proximity\" src=\"https://codepen.io/matfantinel/embed/preview/LYNPdpE?default-tab=result&theme-id=dark\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\">See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matfantinel/pen/LYNPdpE\">scroll-snap-type: Mandatory vs Proximity</a> by Matheus Fantinel (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/matfantinel\">@matfantinel</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.\n</iframe>\n<h3 id=\"scroll-snap-align\">scroll-snap-align<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#scroll-snap-align\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<p>This is a property you add to the children that specifies where the snap points will be in the element. Which means that, whenever the browser automatically snaps the scroll to the element, it will either go to the left/top edge (<code>start</code>), center (<code>center</code>), or right/bottom edge (<code>end</code>) of the element. This property pretty much only makes a difference if the children are bigger than the parent’s display size.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scroll-padding-and-scroll-margin\">scroll-padding and scroll-margin<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#scroll-padding-and-scroll-margin\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h3>\n<p>To make things even better, we can use the <code>scroll-padding</code> (for parent) and <code>scroll-margin</code> (for children) properties. They add some space before/after the elements that are only considered when scrolling. The best way to implement them is by trying it out after you build your scroll snapping goodiness.</p>\n<p>You can check the documentation over on <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Scroll_Snap\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mozilla Developer Network</a> for more info.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#wrapping-up\"><span class=\"heading-link\">#</span></a></h2>\n<p>Scroll snapping is a sign that the web is maturing. For years we’ve been bloating websites with a lot of JavaScript for very simple visual tasks, and now CSS is slowly evolving to take some space back. It’s an important evolution because Web technologies are being used to build every kind of application, and its native feature set needs to be good enough to compete with native or native-ish counterparts like Flutter, Swift, or Kotlin.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>","css":{"code":".code-block.svelte-qgch0c.svelte-qgch0c{display:block;position:relative;background-color:var(--code-background-color);color:var(--code-text-color);font-family:var(--mono-font);font-size:1rem;line-height:1.33em;border-radius:8px;box-shadow:var(--card-shadow);padding:30px 15px;margin:30px 0}.code-block.svelte-qgch0c pre{overflow-x:auto;scrollbar-color:var(--primary-color) var(--scrollbar-track-color);scrollbar-width:thin;padding-bottom:5px}.code-block.svelte-qgch0c pre::-webkit-scrollbar{height:8px}.code-block.svelte-qgch0c pre::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{background:var(--primary-color)}.code-block.svelte-qgch0c pre::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover{background:var(--primary-light-color)}.code-block.svelte-qgch0c .lang.svelte-qgch0c{position:absolute;right:0;top:-15px;background:inherit;border-radius:8px;padding:5px 10px;z-index:2;font-size:0.85em}.code-block.svelte-qgch0c .filename.svelte-qgch0c{background:inherit;border-top-left-radius:8px;border-top-right-radius:8px;margin-bottom:-2px;padding:5px 10px;position:absolute;left:0px;top:-15px;z-index:1}","map":null},"head":"","readingTime":"4 min read"}]}
