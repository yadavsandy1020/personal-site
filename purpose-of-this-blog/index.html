			<div class="content"><p>There are many developer blogs out there, probably because developers like to ramble about the tech they enjoy. I’m guilty of that too! This blog was created mainly for that - sharing about development stuff that I like or that I’m learning. </p>
<p>The purpose is to help myself learn about the subjects better, since there’s no better way to learn than trying to reach someone. Of course, it won’t be made of tutorials only - I intend to write about some theoretical concepts, and maybe tech stuff not related to development.</p>
<p>I consider myself a tech enthusiast. Which means I like to talk about software and gadgets in a way that most other people would find me annoying. This can be a great place to be able to share this with people that may care, hopefully you!</p>
<p>I hope to see you here in future posts, and I hope you enjoy reading what I have to say!</p></div></article>

The ongoing pandemic still affected our lives, and even though most people in my country are now vaccinated (including me), the danger still exists and preventive measures are still necessary. But it’s nice to be able to start doing things and going places we haven’t been able to for a while. I personally think this situation is still going to drag on for a while, but we’ll adapt to it with time.\u003C/p>\\n\u003Ch2 id=\\\"mental-health\\\">Mental Health\u003Ca aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" tabindex=\\\"-1\\\" href=\\\"#mental-health\\\">\u003Cspan class=\\\"heading-link\\\">#\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/h2>\\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\\\"/2020-year-in-review\\\">Last year\u003C/a>, I wrote a bit about doomscrolling, and how it started affecting me until I decided to avoid this behavior.

The year started with the loss of a person I held dear - a victim of the inexcusable vaccination delays and genocidal actions of our leaders - and I felt like I lost a bit of control over my work-life-balance for a portion of the year.\u003C/p>\\n\u003Cp>This year I also started therapy though, which I feel is a good way to deal with the growing anxiety from the past few years.

This has given me more freedom to make my own hours and allowed me to work with a more diverse set of people. It took me a while to use this freedom the right way, though. For a few months I felt like my work-life balance was off, and I felt like my energy was being drained fast. Luckily I was able to notice the early signs of a burnout and took a step back to avoid it. I am now working on my 2nd project as a contractor and I feel that getting the work hours under control allowed me to do my work better, since my mind gets the time to rest.\u003C/p>\\n\u003Ch2 id=\\\"learning-and-comparing\\\">Learning and Comparing\u003Ca aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" tabindex=\\\"-1\\\" href=\\\"#learning-and-comparing\\\">\u003Cspan class=\\\"heading-link\\\">#\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/h2>\\n\u003Cp>Most of the learning I did this year was on my day job, and not personal projects. Last year, I worked a lot with Angular and Vue 2. This year, I worked with Vue 3, React and PHP (😩), and on my personal time I started to practice my Svelte skills. That’s a lot of frameworks!\u003C/p>\\n\u003Cp>Although every project is different, working with components makes you solve similar problems all the time. And after having worked with basically all mainstream frameworks for a bit, I feel like I can see pros and cons to each of them:\u003C/p>\\n\u003Ch3 id=\\\"angular\\\">Angular\u003Ca aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" tabindex=\\\"-1\\\" href=\\\"#angular\\\">\u003Cspan class=\\\"heading-link\\\">#\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/h3>\\n\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Pros:\u003C/strong> it’s very opinionated, which means there are always recommended ways of doing something. This makes the code consistent, and using TypeScript by default makes it much easier to maintain big projects. I like the template syntax and the separation between HTML, CSS and TS. I also can definitely see why it’s a choice in many enterprise environments: the majority of Angular projects I’ve seen have similar structure, which makes devs productive really quickly after being hired.\u003C/p>\u003C/li>\\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Cons:\u003C/strong> it’s very opinionated, which means it’s not as flexible as other options. The focus on clear separation of concerns and TypeScript can also be a burden for smaller apps. Sometimes you want to make a quick prototype or just build something simpler, and it’s easy to find Angular overkill.\u003C/p>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\\n\u003Ch3 id=\\\"vue\\\">Vue\u003Ca aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" tabindex=\\\"-1\\\" href=\\\"#vue\\\">\u003Cspan class=\\\"heading-link\\\">#\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/h3>\\n\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Pros:\u003C/strong> I really like the premise of Vue being “incrementally adoptable”. This makes Vue really simple on the surface and hides many of its complexities. The template syntax is similar to Angular and it’s easy to keep concerns separated if you want to.\u003C/p>\u003C/li>\\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Cons:\u003C/strong> In my personal experience I felt like the Composition API, introduced in Vue 3, goes against my favorite things in Vue previously. Instead of being an extension to HTML/JS, it makes you completely rethink how to build the components, and I feel like it makes things more complicated than they should be. Also, the ecosystem around it (plugins, components, etc) took a big hit with the transition from v2 to v3, because it had many breaking changes.\u003C/p>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\\n\u003Ch3 id=\\\"react\\\">React\u003Ca aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" tabindex=\\\"-1\\\" href=\\\"#react\\\">\u003Cspan class=\\\"heading-link\\\">#\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/h3>\\n\u003Cp>My experience with React has not been as extensive as the other ones here, so I think I’m still not past the point of “initial impressions”. Still, here are my thoughts:\u003C/p>\\n\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Pros:\u003C/strong> Super flexible, and with a ginormous ecosystem to back it up. You can write a React app in so many ways and there’s always an open-source plugin or component for what you want to do. The existence of NextJS makes using React a better experience.\u003C/p>\u003C/li>\\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Cons:\u003C/strong> Ok, I really don’t like JSX. I usually like to keep concerns separated and using JS to build the HTML like this is not my cup of tea. I find it hard to understand at a glance, and feel like it overrides the default web stack too much. Unlike the other frameworks, when I use React I feel like I’m developing a React app instead of a web app. Also, in contrast to Angular, the flexibility of React makes it so that React projects can be so different from one another you’d have a difficult time adapting, even though they use the same framework (this is mitigated by meta-frameworks like NextJS, which are very opinionated, thankfully).\u003C/p>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\\n\u003Ch3 id=\\\"svelte\\\">Svelte\u003Ca aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" tabindex=\\\"-1\\\" href=\\\"#svelte\\\">\u003Cspan class=\\\"heading-link\\\">#\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/h3>\\n\u003Cp>I have a clear favorite here, but I feel that Svelte hits the sweet spot in many ways.\u003C/p>\\n\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Pros:\u003C/strong> I like the template syntax (not as clean as Vue’s or Angular’s, but similar enough), the clear separation of concerns, and how it likes to stay out of your way. Most of all though, I love how Svelte makes me just feel like I’m building a “vanilla” web page, but with added goodies. \u003Cspan class=\\\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\\\">It extends the web instead of replacing it.\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003C/li>\\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>The fact that it is a compiler frees it from the need for a Virtual DOM, which then makes the code you need to write much simpler. No need for \u003Cem>useState\u003C/em>, \u003Cem>useEffect\u003C/em>, or keeping track of two-way binding to maintain state between components - you just have to set the variables and Svelte does the rest. I just think about my logic, not about how the framework works.\u003C/p>\u003C/li>\\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>Its official meta-framework, SvelteKit, also has great defaults. It works by using native HTML tags instead of trying to emulate them. Instead of a \u003Ccode>&lt;Link&gt;\u003C/code>, just use \u003Ccode>&lt;a&gt;\u003C/code>. Instead of using JS to post data, just use a \u003Ccode>&lt;form&gt;\u003C/code>. This makes the app leaner, more accessible, and work with JS disabled by default.\u003C/p>\u003C/li>\\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Cons:\u003C/strong> Svelte is relatively new, and therefore its ecosystem is still lacking. I’ve had trouble properly integrating a SvelteKit project with Storybook or Jest, for example, since Kit is still in Beta. There are also many components that don’t have a Svelte version yet, and while some of them have a “Vanilla JS” option that usually works, it’s still not as seamless as it could be.\u003C/p>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\\n\u003Ch2 id=\\\"personal-projects\\\">Personal Projects\u003Ca aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" tabindex=\\\"-1\\\" href=\\\"#personal-projects\\\">\u003Cspan class=\\\"heading-link\\\">#\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/h2>\\n\u003Cp>I didn’t work on many personal projects this year, as I was already learning a lot on my day job. I did, however, \u003Cspan class=\\\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\\\">completely rewrite my website!\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\\n\u003Cp>I really liked the previous one, but I wanted to change some things about it and use something more flexible than Jekyll.

I’ve never seen a show that can balance comedy, wholesomeness and an enthralling story and characters so well. It touches on delicate subjects in a way that still makes you feel good, and yet is capable of sending the intended message.

As soon as they were released/made public, I started receiving pull requests, bug reports, feature requests, and translations from everywhere. \u003Cstrong>It’s so amazing that people from all over the world took interest in my little idea and helped improve them any way they could.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\\n\u003Cp>But open source is not just other people contributing to your projects, it’s also the opposite! I can improve other people’s apps that I use, I can report bugs openly and help out, or just download the source code, change a few things just to fit my workflow better and run it. And not only apps, I can do that with the entire OS I run on my PC! Not to mention having access to other people’s code allows you to learn from their work and saves you tons of time. Having a problem on your app and you know one that has solved that? Just check out what they did. Copy it, modify it, learn it, ship it. It’s all good.  \u003Cspan class=\\\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\\\">We wouldn’t have to spend so much time reinventing wheels if more of our code was open.\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\\n\u003Cp>Ah, this website is also open source. I used others as inspiration and took some code snippets too! So can you, feel free to fork it and modify anyway you want.\u003C/p>\\n\u003Ch2 id=\\\"working-remotely-is-fun-at-least-for-some-people\\\">Working remotely is fun, at least for some people\u003Ca aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" tabindex=\\\"-1\\\" href=\\\"#working-remotely-is-fun-at-least-for-some-people\\\">\u003Cspan class=\\\"heading-link\\\">#\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/h2>\\n\u003Cp>In August I started working remotely for the first time. I work from my home in Brazil with people from US, Europe and India. It was definitely refreshing to not have to commute and always be at a place that makes you feel good. Not only that, but the flexible hours allow me to work whenever I want and I can enjoy things that weren’t possible on a regular “9 to 5” routine.\u003C/p>\\n\u003Cp>Although… I end up working the same hours as I did before. It feels “right” to work at this time, and I can enjoy my family at night, since they also work during the day. But it’s nice to have the flexibility to have a break and a coffee somewhere else during the day if needed.\u003C/p>\\n\u003Cp>One of the main things people say about working from home is that sometimes it’s hard to separate work time from free time. Fortunately, I didn’t have that issue. My apartment is quite small, so I don’t have a proper office and instead work on a desk on my bedroom, which means the temptation of lying down and sleeping is always beside me. I’m so thankful I am able to resist that and get work done. And after work hours I can fully disconnect from it and not be stressed out, even if I stay on the computer. I totally understand why some people would not enjoy this and would be less productive, fortunately I was not the case.\u003C/p>\\n\u003Cp>The one thing I’d say is worse in my case is communication. I’m not an extremely social person - therefore I don’t miss chitchat during the day with colleagues or anything like that. It’s just that it’s harder to explain code and concepts over a call or screen share. Not everyone is always readily available to explain things because of different timezones, so you have to figure more things out on your own. It’s still doable though, and the days of “just coding” without interruptions are a dream. The pros outweight the cons.\u003C/p>\\n\u003Ch2 id=\\\"theres-never-enough-time\\\">There’s never enough time\u003Ca aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" tabindex=\\\"-1\\\" href=\\\"#theres-never-enough-time\\\">\u003Cspan class=\\\"heading-link\\\">#\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/h2>\\n\u003Cp>This year, I started getting into writing more open source software and started working from home. The latter means I can work more on house chores since there’s no commute and I’m always around! Still, there’s never enough time for me to do what I want to do. I took time to write some elementaryOS apps, but I want to do some web apps too, and code some more, and play some games, watch series, movies, hang out with family, work, write on this blog, oof. This isn’t a new discovery by any means, but I feel like it’s getting worse every year. This is adult life, I guess.\u003C/p>\\n\u003Ch2 id=\\\"wrapping-up\\\">Wrapping up\u003Ca aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" tabindex=\\\"-1\\\" href=\\\"#wrapping-up\\\">\u003Cspan class=\\\"heading-link\\\">#\u003C/span>\u003C/a>\u003C/h2>\\n\u003Cp>Anyway, 2019 was a good year. I (of course) hope to do more and better in 2020, hopefully including more articles here.
